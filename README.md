# HackReading

Welcome to HackReading! This is a productivity application, that helps you organise your notes and better leverage the power of reading to build knowledge. 

This app utilises Natural Language Processing Tools (entity extraction, summarization), and adopts a crowd-sourced and community-curated approach (real-time collaborative discussions via chat functionality). 

How it works!

1. Create a user account
2. Write a new note based on a book which you are reading
3. When you submit your completed note, we conduct entity extraction and auto-summarization of your notes
4. View other people's summaries and discuss in real time via chat
